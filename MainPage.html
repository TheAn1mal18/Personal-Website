        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div>
            <p>I was born and raised in Modesto, California with one brother and a sister. California was not fully fit for a family especially with such high prices so at the age of two me and my family had moved over to Arizona where we stayed in Casa Grande near my grandma because she was the only family we had out in Arizona. Later down the road at the age of 5 I got a new brother named Austin and we became an even bigger family. At that time we moved over to cortina where we could get a bigger house to stay until my sister moved out. We didnâ€™t need such a big house anymore so we moved over to Rancho Bella Vista South. I started attending American Leadership Academy throughout high school and am about to graduate from there and move on to college either starting my bachelors at CAC or going straight to ASU.</p>
